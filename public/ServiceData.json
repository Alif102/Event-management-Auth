        "ans2" : "As we mentioned above, the average price of a planner might hover around $2,000, but many factors impact how much a wedding planner costsâ€”and there is a lot of variation. The factors that can impact the price of a wedding planner are the location of the wedding (transportation and lodging of the team, per-diems, etc.) and the scope of work for the wedding, explains Daniels. A lot of these are unknown until you actually get into the details of planning. Experience and expertise are also big factors but 20 to 25 percent of the budget is a good place to start, she says of determining a planner fee."
